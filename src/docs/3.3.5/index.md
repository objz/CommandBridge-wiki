This is the documentation for CommandBridge.

CommandBridge is a cross-server command execution plugin for Minecraft networks running via Velocity. You define commands in YAML scripts on the proxy, and CB registers and dispatches them across all connected backend servers. No plugin messaging, no player required on the target server, no limitations.

### What's new in 3.3.5


this update fixes a placeholder bug that prevented some scheduled tasks from
ever resuming, adds a configurable task-expiry timer, and redesigns the admin
CLI around resources with consistent rendering across console and in-game chat.

so whats new or fixed:

**scheduled tasks**

- fixed `${arg}` placeholders in `execute` target IDs not being resolved at
  queue time, so affected tasks could never match a connected client and
  never resumed
- new `tasks.expire-after` config option (seconds; default 86400, 0 disables);
  expired tasks are pruned on load and on the 5-minute save tick
- tasks left over with unresolved `${...}` placeholders from earlier versions
  are dropped on load with a warning

**admin commands**

- redesigned the `/cb` tree by resource:
  - `/cb script list | show <name> [group] | enable <name> | disable <name>`
  - `/cb task list | clear <id>`
  - `/cb client list | ping [id] | players <id>`
  - `/cb config show [section] | reload`
- `/cb script show <name>` opens a clickable section navigator (permissions,
  register, defaults, args, commands); pass a group to drill into just that
  group as a syntax-highlighted yaml card
- `/cb script enable|disable <name>` edits the `enabled:` line of the matching
  yaml file in place (comments preserved) and re-pushes registrations to
  connected clients
- `/cb config show` mirrors the same summary + sections layout; drill into a
  section via tab-completion or by clicking it in chat
- every argument-taking subcommand has live tab-completion now (script names,
  script groups, task ids, client ids, config keys)

**rendering**

- single `Report` builder drives every command's chat output, so kvs, section
  headers, bullets, list items, action buttons, and pagination look the same
  everywhere
- `DebugPrinter` exposes generic `printRecord`, `printRecordOverview`, and
  `printList` so any record renders as the same yaml card the old
  `/cb scripts` view used

**removed**

- `/cb scripts`, `/cb tasks`, `/cb list`, `/cb ping` - replaced by the
  resource-scoped forms above (no backwards-compat aliases on v3)
- `/cb task show <id>` and `/cb client show <id>` - their list views already
  show everything useful, no point duplicating
