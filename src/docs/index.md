### What is CommandBridge?

CommandBridge connects your Velocity proxy and backend servers over WebSocket, letting you run commands across your entire network from a single YAML script.

- Define a command once, register it anywhere
- Execute commands on the proxy from a backend, or on backends from the proxy
- Secure connections with TLS and shared-secret authentication
- Works with Paper, Folia, Bukkit, and Velocity
